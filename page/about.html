                    <h1>Role in human societies</h1>
                    <p>Dogs have played an important role in the history of human civilization and were among the first
                        domesticated animals. They were important in hunter-gatherer societies as hunting allies and
                        bodyguards against predators. When livestock were domesticated about 7,000 to 9,000 years ago,
                        dogs served as herders and guardians of sheep, goats, and cattle. Although many still serve in
                        these capacities, dogs are mainly used for social purposes and companionship.</p>

                    <h1>Origin of breeds</h1>
                    <p>Once it became evident that dogs were faster and stronger and could see and hear better than
                        humans, those specimens exhibiting these qualities were interbred to enhance such attributes.
                        Fleet-footed sight hounds were revered by noblemen in the Middle East, while in Europe powerful
                        dogs such as the mastiff were developed to protect home and traveler from harm.

                    <h1>Physical traits and functions</h1>
                    <p>Dogs come in a wide range of shapes and sizes. It is difficult to imagine that a large Great Dane
                        and a tiny poodle are of the same species, but they are genetically identical with the same
                        anatomic features. All dogs have 78 chromosomes, or 39 pairs of chromosomes (humans have 23
                        pairs), and one member of each pair comes from each parent. The normal temperature (rectal) of
                        an adult dog is 100–102.5 °F.</p>
